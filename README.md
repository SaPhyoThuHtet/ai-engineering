Amazon SageMaker, EC2, and Lambda serve different purposes in the AWS ecosystem. SageMaker is a specialized service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models, providing an end-to-end ML workflow without the need to manage infrastructure. EC2 offers general-purpose virtual machines, giving users full control over the operating system, configurations, and applications, making it versatile for a wide range of tasks, including web hosting, databases, or custom ML setups. In contrast, Lambda is a serverless compute service designed for event-driven, short-lived functions, where code is executed in response to triggers, without the need to manage or provision servers.
